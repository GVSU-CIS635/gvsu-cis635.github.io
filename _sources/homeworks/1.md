Examine the dataset "University Student Information" provided above. For each of the six attributes (Student ID, Major, Class Standing, Test Score, Age, Attendance), identify and justify its type (nominal, ordinal, interval-scaled, or ratio-scaled)

### Answer

- **Student ID**:
- **Major**:
- **Class Standing**:
- **Test Score**:
- **Age**:
- **Attendance (%)**:

## Part B. Thinking about common data mining applications

1. This question asks you to think about clustering. Considering an average kitchen, identify 4 clusters of objects. Name them according to their utility. For example, if I were asked to identify 4 clusters in a sporting goods store, I might choose apparel (e.g., shoes, shirts), containers (e.g., backpacks, coolers), sports equipment (e.g., basketball, tennis racquets), and fishing (e.g., rods, lures).

2. Pick one of the following forms of predictive modeling: regression, classification, or ranking. • Describe an application domain or a dataset where you think it would be useful to apply the chosen predictive modeling approach. • What attribute(s) would you be predicting? • What attributes would you use to make the prediction?
