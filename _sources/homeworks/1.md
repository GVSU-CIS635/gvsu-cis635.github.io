<!-- ### Answer -->

<!-- - **Student ID**: Norminal: does not have a quantitative value or order.
- **Major**: Norminal: categories without any inherent order
- **Class Standing**: Ordinal: Indicates a ranking or order
- **Test Score**: Ratio-scaled: Has a true zero point (a score of 0 means no answers were correct). Differences and ratios are meaningful (a score of 80 is twice as much as a score of 40).
- **Age**: Ratio-scaled: A quantitative measure with a meaningful zero point (age of 0). Differences and ratios are meaningful (a 20-year-old is twice as old as a 10-year-old).
- **Attendance (%)**: Ratio-scalsed: itâ€™s a quantitative measure with a true zero point (0% attendance means no attendance at all). Differences and ratios are meaningful. -->

<!-- 1. **Student ID**

   - **Type**: Nominal
   - **Justification**: It serves as a unique identifier without quantitative value or order.

1. **Major**

   - **Type**: Nominal
   - **Justification**: Represents categories (academic majors) that lack inherent order.

2. **Class Standing**

   - **Type**: Ordinal
   - **Justification**: Indicates a clear ranking or sequence (Freshman to Senior) without uniform intervals.

3. **Test Score**

   - **Type**: Ratio-scaled
   - **Justification**: Quantitative measure with a true zero point (0 indicating no correct answers). The differences and ratios are significant and interpretable (e.g., 80 is twice 40).

4. **Age**

   - **Type**: Ratio-scaled
   - **Justification**: A quantitative attribute with a meaningful zero (age 0). The differences and ratios are significant (e.g., a 20-year-old is twice as old as a 10-year-old).

5. **Attendance (%)**
   - **Type**: Ratio-scaled
   - **Justification**: Quantitative measure with a true zero point (0% indicating no attendance). Differences and ratios provide meaningful information. -->

## Part B. Thinking about common data mining applications

1. This question asks you to think about clustering. Consider an average kitchen and identify four clusters of objects based on their utility. For instance, in a sporting goods store, possible clusters could include apparel (e.g., shoes, shirts), containers (e.g., backpacks, coolers), sports equipment (e.g., basketball, tennis racquets), and fishing gear (e.g., rods, lures). Name each kitchen cluster accordingly.

2. Choose one of the following forms of predictive modeling: regression, classification, or ranking.
   - Describe a specific application domain or dataset where your chosen predictive modeling approach would be beneficial.
   - Identify which attribute(s) you would be predicting.
   - List the attributes you would use to make this prediction.
