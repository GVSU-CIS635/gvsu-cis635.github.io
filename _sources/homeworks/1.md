Examine the dataset "University Student Information" provided above. For each of the six attributes (Student ID, Major, Class Standing, Test Score, Age, Attendance), identify and justify its type (nominal, ordinal, interval-scaled, or ratio-scaled)

### Answer

<!-- - **Student ID**: Norminal: does not have a quantitative value or order.
- **Major**: Norminal: categories without any inherent order
- **Class Standing**: Ordinal: Indicates a ranking or order
- **Test Score**: Ratio-scaled: Has a true zero point (a score of 0 means no answers were correct). Differences and ratios are meaningful (a score of 80 is twice as much as a score of 40).
- **Age**: Ratio-scaled: A quantitative measure with a meaningful zero point (age of 0). Differences and ratios are meaningful (a 20-year-old is twice as old as a 10-year-old).
- **Attendance (%)**: Ratio-scalsed: it’s a quantitative measure with a true zero point (0% attendance means no attendance at all). Differences and ratios are meaningful. -->

1. **Student ID**

   - **Type**: Nominal
   - **Justification**: It serves as a unique identifier without quantitative value or order.

2. **Major**

   - **Type**: Nominal
   - **Justification**: Represents categories (academic majors) that lack inherent order.

3. **Class Standing**

   - **Type**: Ordinal
   - **Justification**: Indicates a clear ranking or sequence (Freshman to Senior) without uniform intervals.

4. **Test Score**

   - **Type**: Ratio-scaled
   - **Justification**: Quantitative measure with a true zero point (0 indicating no correct answers). The differences and ratios are significant and interpretable (e.g., 80 is twice 40).

5. **Age**

   - **Type**: Ratio-scaled
   - **Justification**: A quantitative attribute with a meaningful zero (age 0). The differences and ratios are significant (e.g., a 20-year-old is twice as old as a 10-year-old).

6. **Attendance (%)**
   - **Type**: Ratio-scaled
   - **Justification**: Quantitative measure with a true zero point (0% indicating no attendance). Differences and ratios provide meaningful information.

## Part B. Thinking about common data mining applications

1. This question asks you to think about clustering. Considering an average kitchen, identify 4 clusters of objects. Name them according to their utility. For example, if I were asked to identify 4 clusters in a sporting goods store, I might choose apparel (e.g., shoes, shirts), containers (e.g., backpacks, coolers), sports equipment (e.g., basketball, tennis racquets), and fishing (e.g., rods, lures).

2. Pick one of the following forms of predictive modeling: regression, classification, or ranking. • Describe an application domain or a dataset where you think it would be useful to apply the chosen predictive modeling approach. • What attribute(s) would you be predicting? • What attributes would you use to make the prediction?
