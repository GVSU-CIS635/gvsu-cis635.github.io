### About the data set

You'll be working with the "Car93" dataset, which includes 93 rows and 27 columns. The dataset comprises randomly selected car models from 1993, as listed in both the Consumer Reports issue and the PACE Buying Guide. Pickup trucks and Sport/Utility vehicles were excluded due to incomplete information in the Consumer Reports source. Duplicate models (e.g., Dodge Shadow and Plymouth Sundance) were listed at most once.
