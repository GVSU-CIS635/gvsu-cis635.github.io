## Overview

### Objectives

In this assignment, you will:

- Implement a simplified version of the Incremental Association Markov Blanket (IAMB) algorithm based on provided pseudocode.
- Apply IAMB for feature selection on a sample dataset (Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset).
- Evaluate and compare model performance with and without IAMB-based feature selection using **Gaussian Naive Bayes**.
