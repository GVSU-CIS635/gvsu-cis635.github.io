# Homework 3

## Overview

### Objectives

In this assignment, you will implement and evaluate multiple algorithms to classify the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset. Using **5-fold stratified cross-validation**, you will calculate metrics such as **Accuracy**, **F1 Score (weighted)**, and **AUC-ROC (weighted)**. Additionally, you will perform **hyperparameter tuning** for certain algorithms to improve their performance and visualize the **ROC curves** for all classifiers. If class imbalance is identified, you will handle it using appropriate methods.

- The target feature is Outcome, which indicates whether a patient has diabetes (1) or not (0).

### About the Dataset

The Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset, originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, contains data on 768 women from a population near Phoenix, Arizona. The outcome tested is Diabetes, with 258 positive and 500 negative cases. There are eight predictor variables, including:

- **Pregnancies:** Number of times pregnant
- **OGTT:** Oral glucose tolerance test result (two-hour plasma glucose concentration after 75g anhydrous glucose)
- **Blood Pressure:** Diastolic blood pressure (mmHg)
- **Skin Thickness:** Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
- **Insulin:** 2-hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- **BMI:** Body Mass Index (kg/mÂ²)
- **Age:** Age in years
- **Pedigree Diabetes Function:** Likelihood of diabetes based on family history
