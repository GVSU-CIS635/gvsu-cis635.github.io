# Welcome

to our Knowledge Discovery and Data mining course. In this course, weâ€™ll delve into the world of data mining, uncovering valuable insights from vast datasets. Explore techniques for identifying meaningful patterns, correlations, and trends, and apply them to real-world and synthetic data. Topics encompass all stages of knowledge discovery, from association rules to cluster analysis, classification, and regression. Through hands-on coding, students will implement essential data mining algorithms and use existing tools to expand their skill set in practical applications
