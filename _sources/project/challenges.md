# Task: Crime Forecasting

## Overview

The task involves leveraging data science techniques to participate in a real-time crime forecasting challenge inspired by the National Institute of Justice's Real-Time Crime Forecasting Challenge. Your goal is to analyze and forecast place-based crime patterns using provided data and additional relevant sources.

## Objective

Develop an algorithm or model that accurately predicts **crime hotspots** in a specified jurisdiction using the provided Portland Police Bureau (PPB) Calls-for-Service (CFS) dataset. Predictions will focus on specific crime categories over various timeframes.

## Task Deliverables

1. **Data Analysis and Preprocessing**

   - Load and explore the CFS dataset to identify patterns, trends, and features.
   - Handle any missing data or inconsistencies in the dataset.

2. **Model Development**

   - Develop a machine learning or statistical model for forecasting crime locations.
   - Focus on **All Calls-for-Service**
   - Forecast crime hotspots for time periods of:
     - Two weeks

3. **Evaluation Metrics**

   - Use the **Prediction Accuracy Index (PAI)** to measure how well your model predicts hotspots.
   - Use the **Prediction Efficiency Index (PEI)** to evaluate the efficiency of your predictions.
   - Use the **March-May, 2017 Calls-for-Service Data** as the test set to evaluate your solution's PAI and PEI.

4. **Visualization**

   - Provide visualizations of the forecasted crime hotspots.
   - Clearly indicate predicted high-risk areas.

5. **Report**

   - Submit a concise report detailing:
     - Data exploration and preprocessing steps.
     - Model development and chosen features.
     - Evaluation of your modelâ€™s performance.
     - Discussion of challenges faced and potential improvements.
   - Include your visualizations in the report.

6. **Submission**
   - Submit your code as a **GitHub repository**.
   - Share the GitHub repository link with me.

## Data Access

Download the provided data set from the [challenge webpage](https://nij.ojp.gov/funding/real-time-crime-forecasting-challenge-posting). Additional data sources may be used to enrich your analysis, but ensure they are appropriately cited.

## Submission Format

- Share your **GitHub repository** containing:
  - Python code used for analysis and forecasting.
  - Forecast results for each timeframe in a **.csv** format.
  - Visualizations in **.png** or **.jpg** format.
  - A report in **PDF** format.
  - Your resume
  - One page statement

## Evaluation Criteria

1. **Prediction Accuracy and Efficiency**: How accurate and efficient your forecasts are based on PAI and PEI metrics.
2. **Innovation**: Use of novel techniques or approaches in your analysis and forecasting.
3. **Clarity of Visualizations and Report**: How well your findings are presented and explained.

## Deadline

Submit your completed task by **12/02/2024**.
