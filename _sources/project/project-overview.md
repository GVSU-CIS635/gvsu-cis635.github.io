# Final Project Overview

In this data mining project, you'll pick an application area and set up a data mining pipeline for a specific problem in that area.

## Problem Statement

One main goal of this course is to help you learn how to plan, make, and check a data mining pipeline from the start to the end. You will propose, create, and finish a data mining project in an area you like. You'll be guided through some assignments:

- **Project Proposal**
- **Project Progress Report**
- **Project Final Report**

## Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Build and run a full data mining pipeline.
- Plan a data mining project and do background research.
- Get better at using data mining methods and tools.
- Clearly explain your methods and results.

## Groups

This project is team-based. You will need to set up your team, with each team allowed to have up to 5 members.

## Grading

Your final project will count for 40% of your grade in this course:

| Task             | Grade Part |
| ---------------- | ---------- |
| Project Proposal | 5%         |
| Progress Report  | 15%        |
| Final Report     | 20%        |

> **Note:** You cannot use your homework extensions on project components.

All components of your final project are subject to GVSU and the School of Computingâ€™s academic honesty policies. Violations of these policies on your final project will likely result in failure from the course.

## Possible project ideas

Although we have not covered all the topics in this course, However, we have overviewed broad categories of data mining tasks. My advice is to start by choosing a domain that is interesting to you and a type of data mining task that you think is applicable (and that you are interested in learning more about). You will then need to do your own research on the specifics.

Some example types of projects (your project does not need to fall under any of these categories)::

- **Solve a Problem:** Make a data mining plan for a problem you care about. Test your plan against another one.
- **Try a Study:** Find a study you like and try some of it yourself. You need to make your own plan, not just use the old one.
- **Research a Question:** Think of a question and make a data mining plan to find the answer.
- **Analysis:** Make or find a data mining plan for a task and see how well it works. You can change parts of the plan to make it better.

### Dataset Options for Your Project

You're free to select any public dataset for your project. Here are some suggestions based on the theme of your project:

- **Crime Hotspots Forecasting:**

  - Consider using: [Calls-for-service data](https://nij.ojp.gov/funding/real-time-crime-forecasting-challenge-posting#data)
  - [More details](../assets/pdf/crime-hotspots-forecasting.pdf)

- **Streamflow Forecasting:**

  - Recommended dataset: [Streamflow](../assets/data/streamflow.csv)
