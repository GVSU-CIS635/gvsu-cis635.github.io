# Project Progress Report

The project progress report is an essential part of your final project. This report is your opportunity to reflect on the work you've done so far, identify any challenges you've encountered, and plan your next steps. Regular progress updates help ensure consistent work on the project and reduce the likelihood of last-minute rushes.

You should not wait for my feedback on your progress update before resuming work on your project.

## Requirements

Your progress update report should be a concise yet comprehensive document of approximately one to two pages covering the following areas:

- **Project Progress Overview**

  - Completed Tasks: Detail what portions of the project you have successfully completed up to this point.
  - Data: Provide links to the datasets you're utilizing.

- **Challenges**

  - Encountered Difficulties: Discuss any significant challenges you have faced during the project. This could include technical difficulties, conceptual misunderstandings, or data issues.
  - Describe how you addressed these challenges. If some challenges remain unresolved, outline your proposed approach to tackle them moving forward.

- **Collaboration**

  - How frequently does your group meet?
  - Does everyone feel like each group member is contributing meaningfully to the project? If not, how does your group plan address this problem?

- **Next steps**

  - Remaining Tasks: Outline what still needs to be accomplished on your project.
  - What is your plan to complete the remaining tasks?
  - Do you foresee any potential challenges?

Organize your progress report into sections (one for each of the categories above).

## Delivery

Please submit your report (in PDF format) to **Blackboard** and your team **GitHub repository**. One submission per group. Include in the comments section of the assignment the names of the group members.
