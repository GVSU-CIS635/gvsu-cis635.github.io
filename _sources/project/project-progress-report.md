# Project Progress Update

The project progress report is an essential part of your final project. This report is your opportunity to reflect on the work you've done so far, identify any challenges you've encountered, and plan your next steps. Regular progress updates help ensure consistent work on the project and reduce the likelihood of last-minute rushes.

You should not wait for my feedback on your progress update before resuming work on your project.

## Requirements

Your progress update report should be a concise yet comprehensive document of approximately one to two pages covering the following areas:

- **Progress so far**

  - Completed Tasks: Detail what portions of the project you have successfully completed up to this point.
  - Data: Provide links to the datasets you're utilizing.

- **Challenges**

  - Encountered Difficulties: Discuss any significant challenges you have faced during the project. This could include technical difficulties, conceptual misunderstandings, or data issues.
  - Describe how you addressed these challenges. If some challenges remain unresolved, outline your proposed approach to tackle them moving forward.

- **Collaboration** (if applicable)

  - How frequently does your group meet?
  - Does everyone feel like each group member is contributing meaningfully to the project? If not, how does your group plan address this problem?

- **Next steps**

  - Remaining Tasks: Outline what still needs to be accomplished on your project.
  - What is your plan to complete the remaining tasks?
  - Do you foresee any potential challenges?

Organize your progress report into sections (one for each of the categories above).

## Delivery

Please submit your report (in PDF format) to **Blackboard** and your team **GitHub repository**. One submission per group. Include in the comments section of the assignment the names of the group members.

## Grading

Your progress report will be evaluated based on the following criteria, totaling 100 points:

| Item                                 | Points |
| ------------------------------------ | ------ |
| Coverage of Required Points Above    | 80     |
| Overall Organization of the Document | 10     |
| Formality and Clarity of Writing     | 10     |

All components of your final project are subject to GVSU and the School of Computingâ€™s academic honesty policies. Violations of these policies may result in failure from the course.

<!-- - **Progress Report:** Submit your team's progress report to your GitHub repository. Only one submission per team is required.
- **Code Submission:** Push your project code to the same repository. If you're using Google Colab notebooks, you can save your notebook directly to GitHub. Just click `File` in the Colab menu and choose `Save a copy in GitHub`.

Ensure you can access your GitHub account using an SSH Key. If you haven't set this up, follow the steps below or check this [tutorial](https://youtu.be/a-zX_qc2S-M).

1. Open a Git terminal. If you haven't yet configured an SSH key for GitHub on your machine, generate a new one with the following command:

   ```bash
   ssh-keygen
````

1. Navigate to your GitHub account settings. Click on "SSH and GPG keys" and then "New SSH key". Paste the public key that was generated in the first step and click "Add SSH key".

2. Set up your GitHub username and email on your local machine in a Git terminal. You can do this with the following commands:

   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"
   ```

3. Now you're ready to clone the repository. In your Git terminal, enter the following command to download the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone [YOUR_REPO_LINK]
   ```

   You can get YOUR_REPO_LINK in the assignment repo under your GitHub account:-->
