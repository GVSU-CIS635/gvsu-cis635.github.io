# Final Project Final Report

The documentation of your work is as crucial as building your data mining pipeline and generating results. If you don't effectively document your pipeline and your findings, and present them in an easily understandable format, the value of your work might not be fully recognized!

## Format

You are free to choose the format for your final report, but it must be well-organized, employ consistent formatting for citations/references, and include the required content (outlined below). Please note that I may not be able to respond to emails after 5:00 pm on the due date of your assignment.

**Suggested formats** for your report:

- **LaTeX to PDF:**
  - If using LaTeX, consider Overleaf – it's similar to Google Docs but for LaTeX.
- **Text Editor to PDF:**

For those planning to use this project in a portfolio for potential employers, crafting your report as a well-formatted web page (interactive, if feasible) is strongly recommended. I am available to guide you on how to do this.

## Contents

Your report should include:

- **Introduction**
- **Related Work**
- **Methods**
- **Results and Discussion**
- **Conclusion**
- **Data and Software Availability**
- **References**

Subsections within these sections are encouraged.

To deviate from this structure, please consult with me at least a week before the deadline. Valid reasons might include submission to a conference or competition requiring a different format, or creation of an interactive document.

### Introduction

Your introduction should:

- Introduce your application domain and specific problem, providing enough context for readers to grasp the value of your project.
- Motivation of your project.
- Give an overview of your approach and results.

### Related Work

Your related work section should:

- Discuss prior work relevant to your project, such as alternative approaches to your problem or similar applications of your method in other domains.
- Include at least three references to academic publications.

Use academic sources like [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) or [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) for your references.

### Methods

Your methods section should:

- Detail how you chose or collected your data.
- Describe your data mining pipeline in enough detail to allow replication.
- Include any model evaluation analyses performed.
- Mention the software used.

Diagrams summarizing your methodology are beneficial.

### Results and Discussion

This section should:

- Detail and discuss your results.
- Include high-quality visualizations for effective communication.
- Consider embedding interactive visualizations, depending on your report format.

### Conclusion

Your conclusion should:

- Summarize your findings briefly.
- Discuss any limitations or shortcomings.
- Suggest future work or possible project extensions.

### Data and Software Availability

This section should:

- Provide links for software download (e.g., GitHub repository) and data access.

If providing links is not feasible, inform me at least a week before the deadline.

### References

Ensure that your references are consistently formatted, including authors, year, title, venue/journal, and DOI.

For LaTeX users, I can assist in configuring automatic reference formatting.

### Delivery

Please submit your report (in PDF format) to **Blackboard** and your team **GitHub repository**. One submission per group. Include in the comments section of the assignment the names of the group members.

## Grading

Your report will be graded out of 100 based on:

| Item                                                   | Points |

| Conclusion                                             | 10     |
| Data and software availability                         | 10     |
| Consistently formatted references                      | 5      |
| Executable code with instructions                      | 10     |
| Well-organized report with logical structure           | 10     |
| Professional quality (few spelling/grammatical errors) | 10     |

I reserve the right to award flex points for exemplary work in any areas of this project.
